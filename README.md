# confetti_cuisine-expressjs
I’ll start a new application from scratch and add three views, routes for the views and assets, and a public client folder. To start, I’ll build out the application logic with the goal of clean, nonrepetitive code. Then I’ll add some of the public-facing views and custom styling. At the end of this lesson, I’ll have a web server to handle requests to specific files and assets in the project. The final product is one that I can gradually build on and connect to a database at my client’s request.
# To create this application, I use the following steps:
## * Initialize the application package.json.
## * Set up the project directory structure.
## * Create application logic in main.js.
## => Create three views, each of which should have a clickable image that can be served independently :
    - Index (home).
    - Courses.
    - Contact.
    - Thanks.
    - Error.
### Add custom assets.
### Build the application’s router.
